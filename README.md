## About Advent of Code

Advent of Code is an [Advent calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advent_calendar) of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, 
or to challenge each other.

You don't need a computer science background to participate - just a little programming knowledge and some 
[problem solving skills](https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/comments/7kd8jt/comment/dre0uu3/) will get you pretty far. 
Nor do you need a fancy computer; every problem has a solution that completes in at most 15 seconds on ten-year-old hardware.
